                This is a web app that centralizes a student's qualifications. Schools, institutions, employers, or other
                figures of authority to report a student's coursework, letters of recommendation, or other accolades to this
                app, ensuring that the materials can't be tampered with by the student. The student then must allow a
                prospective school or employer to review their qualifications, easing the review process as all documents
                will be included here, and it is also lessens the burden on the instutitions providing documents.
